# Lox Interpreter in TypeScript

A **tree-walk interpreter** for the Lox programming language, implemented in **TypeScript**.  
Based on the first interpreter from Bob Nystromâ€™s book *[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)*,
this project brings Lox to the TypeScript ecosystem.

## ðŸ“œ About

Lox is a small, dynamically-typed scripting language designed for learning how interpreters and compilers work.  
This implementation follows the **tree-walk** approach:

1. **Lexing** â†’ Convert raw source code into tokens.
2. **Parsing** â†’ Build an abstract syntax tree (AST) from tokens.
3. **Interpreting** â†’ Traverse the AST and execute code directly.
